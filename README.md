# Line Coding Scheme Simulator

This project is a Java-based simulator for various line coding schemes used in digital communication. It provides visual representations of different encoding techniques to help understand their characteristics and performance.

## Overview

Line coding schemes are essential in digital communication systems for converting binary data into digital signals suitable for transmission over communication channels. This simulator allows users to explore and visualize different line coding schemes, including:


- RZ Encoding
- NRZ-L Encoding
- NRZ-I Encoding
- Manchester Encoding
- Differential Manchester Encoding
- Bipolar Encoding (e.g., AMI [Alternate Mark Inversion] , Pseudoternary )

The simulator provides a graphical interface to visualize how each encoding scheme represents digital data and how the transmitted signal looks. Users can adjust parameters such as signal frequency and data patterns to observe their effects on signal encoding and transmission.

## Features

- Visual representation of various line coding schemes
- Adjustable parameters for signal frequency and data patterns
- Intuitive graphical user interface for easy interaction
- Educational tool for learning about digital communication techniques
- Cross-platform compatibility (Java-based)

## Usage

To use the simulator, simply run the Java program and interact with the graphical interface. Adjust parameters as needed to observe the effects on signal encoding and transmission. The simulator provides real-time visual feedback, allowing users to understand the behavior of different line coding schemes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Eclipse or any Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the Java program .
4. Interact with the graphical interface to explore different line coding schemes.
